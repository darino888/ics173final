We decided to get all the data the CDC has on race.  Over 8 million
records.  I was curious about what races had the most comorbidity.

Prior to plotting the data, I had to remove records where the race
information was "unknown" -- this could inject huge bias into this
study.  Not sure how to deal with this problem.

FUTURE: compute the percentages of cases with comorbidity versus the
total cases and put those stats on the bars.
